2.Help with finding inspiration for meals by searching for recipes on the site.

3.Help in controlling meals through a planner in which we record individual meals and their calories, 
the planner also calculates all calories consumed during the day.

4.The ability to send a message / suggestion to the creator of the website.

*Status of the project : in progress*
In addition, it will have an alert if we exceed our daily caloric requirement or if these calories are not enough. 
It will be possible to send a given meal from the search engine directly to the planner. 
Besides, the calories of meals will be already calculated in the search engine
